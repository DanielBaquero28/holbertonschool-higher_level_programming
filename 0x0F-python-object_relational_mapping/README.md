<h1>Project: Python Object Relational Mapping</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we will understand how to manage MySQL databases as objects.</strong></p>
<body>
<li>Task 0: Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.</li>
<li>Task 1: Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.</li>
<li>Task 2: Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.</li>
<li>Task 3: Write a script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument. But this time, write one that is safe from MySQL injections!</li>
<li>Task 4: Write a script that lists all cities from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa.</li>
<li>Task 5: Write a script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state, using the database hbtn_0e_4_usa.</li>
<li>Task 6: Write a python file that contains the class definition of a State and an instance Base = declarative_base().</li>
<li>Task 7: Write a script that lists all State objects from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.</li>
<li>Task 8: Write a script that prints the first State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.</li>
<li>Task 9: Write a script that lists all State objects that contain the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.</li>
<li>Task 10: Write a script that prints the State object with the name passed as argument from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.</li>
<li>Task 11: Write a script that adds the State object “Louisiana” to the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.</li>
<li>Task 12: Write a script that changes the name of a State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.</li>
<li>Task 13: Write a script that deletes all State objects with a name containing the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa.</li>
<li>Task 14: Write a Python file similar to model_state.py named model_city.py that contains the class definition of a City.</li>
