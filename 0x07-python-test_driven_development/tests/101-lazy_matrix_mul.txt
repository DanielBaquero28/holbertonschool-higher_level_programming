=======================================
Doctest for 100-lazy_matrix_mul.py
=======================================

This is a .txt file that tests all of the edge cases of the program:
100-lazy_matrix_mul.py

It has one function: lazy_matrix_mul()

Numbers
=======

``lazy_matrix_mul()`` returns the multiplication of two matrices.

::

	>>> lazy_matrix_mul = __import__('101-lazy_matrix_mul').lazy_matrix_mul

Accepts integers.

::

	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
	[[ 7 10]
 	[15 22]]

Another case with integers, less lists.

::

	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]]))
	[[13 16]]

Testing with floats.

::

	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1.9, 2.9]], [[3.9, 4.9], [5.9, 6.9]]))
	[[24.52 29.32]]

Doesn't accept string as first argument.

::

	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul("hello", [[1, 2, 3]]))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: m_a must be a list

Doesn't accept string as second argument.

::

	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2, 3]], "hello"))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: m_b must be a list

Doesn't accept a string as a list of strings as the first argument.

::
	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2, 3], "markers"], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: m_a must be a list of lists

Doesn't accept a string as a list of strings as the second argument.

::
	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], "whiteboard"]))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: m_b must be a list of lists

First argument doesn't accept empty list.

::
	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[]], [[1, 2, 3]]))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ValueError: m_a can't be empty

Second argument doesn't accept empty list.

::

	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1]], []))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ValueError: m_b can't be empty

List doesn't accept strings as elements in the first argument

::

	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2, "3"]], [[4, 5, 6]]))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: m_a should contain only integers or floats

List doesn't accept strings as elements in the second argument

::

	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2, 3]], [[4, 5, "7"]]))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: m_b should contain only integers or floats

Doesn't accept lists of different sizes in the first argument.

::

	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]], [[6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 1]]))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: each row of m_a must be of the same size

Doesn't accept lists of different sizes in the second argument.

::

	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 1]]))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: each row of m_b must be of the same size

Doesn't multiply among matrices.

::

	>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6]]))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be multiplied
