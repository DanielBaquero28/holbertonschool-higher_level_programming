==============================
Doctest in 2-matrix_divided.py
==============================

This is a .txt file that tests all of the edge cases of the program:
2-matrix_divided.py

It has one function: matrix_divided()

Numbers
=======

``matrix_divided()`` returns new_matriz with the elements divided by div.
For numbers, that value is equivalent to using the ``/`` operator.

::

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
	>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]], 1)
	[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]


Float type numbers are accepted as elements in the lists but casted to integer.

::

	>>> matrix_divided([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]], 1.0)
	[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]


Tuples are not accepted as only lists are taken into account.

::

	>>> matrix_divided(((1, 2, 3),(4, 5, 6)), 1)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Non-Numbers
===========

Other data types besides int or float are not accepted as elements in the list.

::

A string as en element is not accepted as an element of the list.

::

	>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, '3'],[4, 5, 6]], 1)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Other data types besides int of float are not accepted as div.

::

	>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]], 'monty')
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: div must be a number

0 as the value of div is not accepted.

::

	>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]], 0)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Doesn't accept one of it's elements because it's a tuple.

::

	>>> matrix_divided([[1, -1], (2, -2), [3, -3]], 1)
    	Traceback (most recent call last):
    	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Doesn't accept div as a list.

::

	>>> matrix_divided([[5.7, 8.1], [7.7, 4.9]], [2])
    	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: div must be a number

List Length
===========

The length of all of the lists must be the same otherwise it returns an error.

::

Different length between the lists is not accepted.

::

	>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2],[3, 4, 5, 6]], 1)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Arguments
=========

It doesn't accept more than 2 arguments

::

	>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 1, 32)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix_divided() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
