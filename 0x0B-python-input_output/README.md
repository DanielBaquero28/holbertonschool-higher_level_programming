<h1>Project: Python Input/Output</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we will learn how to open, read, write and close files, and also output them.</strong></p>
<body>
<li>Task 0: Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout:.</li>
<li>Task 1: Write a function that returns the number of lines of a text file.</li>
<li>Task 2: Write a function that reads n lines of a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout.</li>
<li>Task 3: Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written.</li>
<li>Task 4: Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added.</li>
<li>Task 5: Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string).</li>
<li>Task 6: Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string.</li>
<li>Task 7: Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation.</li>
<li>Task 8: Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”.</li>
<li>Task 9: Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file.</li>
<li>Task 10: Write a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object.</li>
<li>Task 11: Write a class Student that defines a student.</li>
<li>Task 12: Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 11-student.py).</li>
<li>Task 13: Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 12-student.py).</li>
<li>Task 14: Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n.</li>
<li>Advanced Task 15: Write a function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string (see example).</li>
<li>Advanced Task 16: Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics.</li>
<li>Advanced Task 17: Write a script that finds a string in the heap of a running process, and replaces it.</li>
