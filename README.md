<h1>Repository: High Level Programming</h1>
<h2>Description of the Project</h2>
<p><strong>In this respository you will find different topics regarding high level languages such as: Python, JavaScript and SQL. This project was done in order to have a basic understanding of these programming languages and develop different projects that require this knowledge. Regarding Python, you'll see some functional programming at the beginning of the project as well as object-oriented programming. After that, you'll see two projects reviewing an introduction of SQL. For last, you'll see some functional programming done in JavaScript and web scrapping with JQuery.</strong></p>
<h2>About Myself</h2>
<p>My name is Daniel Baquero. I'm a software engineer currently doing a specialization in Augmented and Virtual Reality, two types of tech which I'm very passionate about. I'm open to learn new things everyday and I never back down from a challenge. I consider myself organized, not only in my coding style but in my personal life. I like to work with other people and overcome difficulties as a team, this is because I enjoy learning from them as well as helping them out as much as I can. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-alejandro-baquero-arias-106a45195/">LinkedIn</a> - <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielB30589105">Twitter - </a><a href="https://github.com/DanielBaquero28/RacingTourApp">Portafolio Project</a></p>
